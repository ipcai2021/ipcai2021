                    For the first time, IPCAI will provide an opportunity for the CAI community to showcase scientific breakthroughs and novel ideas. Authors will be able to submit Long Abstracts to be presented as oral and poster presentations at IPCAI. The focus of these Long Abstracts will be on:
                    </p>
                    <h3><ul> 
                        <li>Exciting new breakthroughs relevant to IPCAI or,</li>
                        <li>Novel ideas with preliminary but limited experimental validation.</li>
                    </ul></h3>
                    <p>
                    Long Abstracts will be peer-reviewed based on novelty and potential interest to the IPCAI audience. Another call with details will follow closer to the Long Abstract deadline of January 11, 2019.
